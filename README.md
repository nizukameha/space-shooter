# Space-shooter

This project was developed during my studies at [Simplon](https://simplon.co/formation/developpeur-web-et-web-mobile/11). It is a game that runs in the browser. I developed it using Typescript without any frameworks. The project was built with npm and parcel.
## Technical Aspects
- Use of objects (with interfaces)
- Data modification during gameplay
- Separation of data and display
- DOM
### Home
The page presents the controls for playing and offers two difficulty modes (easy or hard).
### The game
It is a vertical shooter where you control a spaceship navigating through space. Enemies, represented by planets and galaxies, appear from the upper corner of the game area. Enemies move vertically. If the player collides with them, health bar decreases (until it is empty). The player has the ability to shoot with their spaceship, but the ammunition is limited. However, power-up items appear to provide additional ammunition. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score.
